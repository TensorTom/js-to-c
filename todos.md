# Todos

- Fix GC
  - strings not traversed
  - object string keys not traversed!
  - uh... not working very well full stop
- Object System
  - Object.prototype -> prelude
  - prelude - it'd be really useful to define lots of the functionality in JS, and compile it (bootstrap the minimum required in C)
      - * immediate use case - implement `new Error` (see exceptions.toml)
  - method calls - setting this in `obj.method()`
- Arrays
- varargs: currently stuff like console.log only takes one args
- functions passing too few arguments
  - should pass in undefineds
- warning on missing
- logical expressions
- Number formatting, e.g 1 -> 1, 0.1 -> 0.1, not 1.00000 and 0.10000
- var hoisting
  - variable
  - functions
- GC optimisation - at the mo free list fragments in a way that'd be trivial to defrag while processing (as lots of it is likely continugous)
