# Todos

- Arrays
- Object System
  - Object.prototype -> prelude
  - method calls - setting this in `obj.method()`
- prelude - it'd be really useful to define lots of the functionality in JS, and compile it (bootstrap the minimum required in C)
- varargs: currently stuff like console.log only takes one args
- var hoisting
  - variable
  - functions
- functions passing too few arguments
  - should pass in undefineds
- warning on missing
- control flow
  - if
  - loops
    - break statement in for/while/etc
    - continue statement
- logical expressions
- Number formatting, e.g 1 -> 1, 0.1 -> 0.1, not 1.00000 and 0.10000
